Soul Shards is a TTRPG (table top role-playing game). This repository contains the files needed for its wikipedia-like website.

It uses Firebase for authentication, firestore for databases with NextJS 13 app router. So if you are interested in the implementations of these two technologies you can use it as an example. Remember that Firebase config will need a .env file.
